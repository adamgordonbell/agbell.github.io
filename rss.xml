  <p>This blog was on tumblr, which was easy to setup and post and such. However, I spend like 8 hours a day with a text editor open and a git in terminal window. Also I’m always look for an excuse to use haskell. So I’m moving things over to <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. I followed <a href="http://www.stackbuilders.com/news/dr-hakyll-create-a-github-page-with-hakyll-and-circleci">this great tutorial</a> on how to setup things up with CircleCI, so now I just commit and push and my site updates.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>

  <p>We have heard of a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It is said that knowledge is power, and the like. Methinks there is equal need of a Society for the Difussion of Useful Ignorance, what we will call Beautiful Knowledge, a knowledge useful in a higher sense: for what is most of our boasted so-called knowledge but a conceit that we know something, which robs us of the advantage of our actual ignorance? What we call knowledge is often our positive ignorance; ignorance our negative knowledge.</p>

  <p>Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveler asked Wordsworth’s servant to show him her master’s study, she answered, “Here is his library, but his study is out of doors.”</p>
