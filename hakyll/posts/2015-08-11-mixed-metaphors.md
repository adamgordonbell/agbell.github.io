Here I'm collecting some mixed metaphors that I thought were funny. Hopefully for use in a presentation about comedy I am doing

* I wouldn't eat that with a ten foot pole
 <!--more-->
* She has a heart as big as gold
* He's likes a duck out of water
* I'm going to sleep like a baby's bottom
* I have to pee like a gift horse: in the mouth
* Six of one man's garbage is a half dozen of the others
* He's a wolf in cheap clothing
* Wake up and smell the coffee on the wall
* It's like shooting fish in a barrel full of monkeys.
* He's got a lot of shoes to fill
* Don't throw stones in a glass bottom boat.
* An apple a day doesn't fall far from the tree.
* Looks like the cows have come home to roost.
* You can lead a cat to a bag but you can't make him drink.
* Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, give a man a whale, he'll eat for a month, maybe more.
* We'll burn that bridge when we get to it
* He was watching me like I was a hawk.
* I’m watching everything you do with a fine-tuned comb.
* Button your seat belts
* It ain’t rocket surgery
