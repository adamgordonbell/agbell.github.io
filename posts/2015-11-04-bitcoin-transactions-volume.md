### Simple Estimate (based on extrapolation of graph) : ###

 * Averaged over 90 days, the transaction volume is climbing consistently. [Chart](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=90&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) 
 * But, it goes sideways or slightly down in periods of up to 6 months long, which could leave it below 125, so I will say 25% chance of below 125.
 * Going above 250 would represent 100k rise, which hasn't happen in the past.  25%
 * The remaining probabilty is 50%.
 * 
 
### Can we break it down further? ###

* Who is making these transactions? What is causing the increase?
 * [Some represent a stress test of the network](https://tradeblock.com/blog/analysis-of-bitcoin-transaction-size-trends)
 * [rest is a wide demographic](https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/07/15/bitcoin-trends-in-1h-2015/) 
* How many transactions per day can bitcoin handle
  * Currently 7 transactions per second which is 600K transactions in day, so does not affect prediction
* 

## Other predictors ##

 * other predictors on gjp have a more extreme prediction around 10/75/15
