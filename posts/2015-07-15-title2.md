Problem:

I want to use emacs like I use notepadd++ on windows.

<span>That is:</span>

*   Right click menu item to “edit with Emacs”
*   Associate file types with emacs (like .org)
*   Have only one emacs open at a time

Here are the steps I took:

1.  Create the context menu like this ([global_context_emacs.reg](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MsWindowsGlobalContextMenu)) :

    > <pre class="real">REGEDIT4 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell] [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\openwemacs] @="&GNU Emacs" # The above value appears in the global context menu, # i.e., when you right click on a file. # (The '&' makes the next character a shortcut.) "Icon"="C:\\Program Files\\Emacs\\bin\\emacs.exe,0" # The above uses the icon of the Emacs exe for the context # and should match the path used for the command below. # The ,0 selects the main icon. [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\openwemacs\command] @="C:\\Program Files\\Emacs\\bin\\runemacs.exe \"%1\"" # The above has to point to where you install Emacs  
    >
    >
    > </pre>

2.  <span>Create a batch file called runclientw.bat and compile to exe and associate file types as needed. See [here](http://robert-adesam.blogspot.ca/2011/01/emacsclient-setup-on-windows-7-starter.html)</span>
