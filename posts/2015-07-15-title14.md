You have made a project using attribute based caching, but the cache isn’t being hit?

<span>Does the test project included in the source work?</span>

*   <span>if you look at the test.csproj you can see the <span class="il">postsharp</span> targets line:  

    [http://cache.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/5279#75842](http://cache.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/5279#75842)  

    <pre> <span><</span><span>Import</span> <span>Project</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>..\Cache\lib\<span class="il">PostSharp</span>\<span class="il">PostSharp</span>.targets</span><span>"</span> <span>/></span>  

    </pre>

    You need that line in project containing the attributes or alternatively you can run the post-sharp installer which will handle this automatically.</span>

If the test project isn’t working, please email me. agbell at google’s email service.
