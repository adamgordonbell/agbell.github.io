By Hand:

There are 12 * 100 first of the months, 1/7 of them fall on sundays, therefore euler19 = 1200/7 ~= 171

In haskell:

<div class="highlight">

<pre>euler19 = length $ filter isSunday [(year,month) | year <- [1901..2000], month <- [1..12]] isSunday :: (Integer,Int) -> Bool isSunday (year, month) = isSunday1 $ toWeekDate $ fromGregorian year month 01 where isSunday1 (_,_,7) = True isSunday1 _ = False </pre>

</div>
