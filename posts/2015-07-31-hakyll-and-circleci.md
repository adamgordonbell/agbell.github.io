This blog was on tumblr, which was easy to setup and post and such.  However, I spend like 8 hours a day with a text editor open and a git in terminal window. Also I'm always look for an excuse to use haskell.  So I'm moving things over to [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). I followed [this great tutorial](http://www.stackbuilders.com/news/dr-hakyll-create-a-github-page-with-hakyll-and-circleci) on how to setup things up with CircleCI, so now I just commit and push and my site updates.  

So far, so good.
