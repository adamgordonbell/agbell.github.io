Routine
============
The comedy book suggests I take some common idioms or quotes and rewrite them to be funny.  Here is what I have got:

The customer is always      writing me angry emails

Any sufficiently advanced technology is
* going to need to be fixed when I visit my uncles house
* going confuse my mom


Speaking of Technology. Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a truly epic battle, try watching my mom  attempt to "find the internet" by wandering around her house with her Ipad.

And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly.  Yesterday my wife's great uncle responded to her EMAIL with a hand written letter.  She looked about as confused as Rob Ford on jeopardy.  It came in the mail! Thats Crazy! I would have been less shocked had it not been addressed.  Kourtney O'Dwyer, peterbough, British colony of upper canada.  God save the king.

The things is, though, Old people have a lot of skills that I do not.  Like the ability to give directions based on local information. Yesterday I got the following directions from an old man.  "Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live and if you pass aphothecary you've gone too far"

The school I went to as a child was not very diverse.  Years later, I'm in university and I met some girls at a bar and one of them happens to have gone to the same school as me, but one year ahead.  She said you probably remember me, i was the black kid.

I was at the dentist that other day.  Strange thing about me, from a dentists perspective is that I have all my wisdom teeth. Once I asked my dentist about getting them out. And he says, I swear, "Ah, you'll be fine horse mouth".  And I'm just sitting there, kind of trying to process it while he backtracks says " Ah, you have kind of a big jaw, and ..."

So I'd like to thank Brad pushing me out of my comfort zone. I feel I learned a little bit about comedy.  I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs "You can lead a fish to water, but you have to do it real fast or it will die." So actually, thats a quote from Gary Busey but I think the point still holds.
