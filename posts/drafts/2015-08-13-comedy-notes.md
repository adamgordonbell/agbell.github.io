 * Reading here in "Comedy Writing Secrets" it says, working with groups of 10 or less is the hardest audience availabe in comedy.  Try to focus in on one person, and maybe wink at them to try to get them laughing and hopefully other will follow.
 * Wink
 * I find its helpful to say the word wink, as you wink.
 * In truth, I feel I haven't totally mastered the wink, one I've learned is when not to use them.  "No officer, I haven't been drinking WINK", "Of course I'll finish that work on Time Brad, WINK"

Ideas:
 * So after Brads pushing me out of my comfort zone, I feel I learned a little bit about comedy.  I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs "You can lead a Herring to water, but you have to do it real fast or he'll die." Actually, thats a quote from Rose on the Golden Girls, Bettie White, but I think the point still holds.

 Why we laugh :
  * Surprise and Superiority

 Recipe for Humor : Threes
  * Target - Humor is criticism cloaked as entertainment and directed at a specific target.
  * Hostility
  * Realism
  * Exaggeration
  * Emotion
  * Surprise

 One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.

Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic.

Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a true battle,  watch my mom try to "find the internet" on her tablet.

And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly.  Yesterday my wife looked more confused  than Rob Ford would look on jeopardy, when he great uncle responded to her email with a hand written letter.  I would have been less shocked had it not been addressed.  Kourtney O'Dwyer, peterbough, British colony of upper canada.  God save the king.

Old people have a lot of skills that we younger people lack however.  Like the ability to give directions based on local information. In the era before GPS's I once got the following directions from an old man.  "Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live, then take a right near where that Eye talian apothecary is and if you see the signs for HogTown you've gone to far." Hogtown I learned the hard way, after driving 20 minutes in teh wrong direction, is the nickname for Toronto used in the 1920's"  

 Computer:
  * a really big smartphone that can't make phone calls

"The ipod completely changed the way we approach music.  Ear buds completely change the way I prevent people from talking to me on the bus."

"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly happy is to do what you beleive is great work.  And the only way to do what you beleive is great work is delusional narcissism."

"software development is like "

The comedy book suggests I take some common idioms or quotes and rewrite them to be funny.  Here is what I have got:


"The ipod completely changed the way we approach music.  Ear buds completely change the way I prevent people from talking to me on the bus."

"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly happy is to do what you beleive is great work.  And the only way to do what you beleive is great work to be a delusional naricisist."

Speaking of Technology. Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a truly epic battle,  watch my mom try to "find the internet" on her tablet.

And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly.  Yesterday my wife looked more confused  than Rob Ford would look on jeopardy, when her great uncle responded to her email with a hand written letter. It came in the mail! Thats Crazy! I would have been less shocked had it not been addressed.  Kourtney O'Dwyer, peterbough, British colony of upper canada.  God save the king.

The things is, though, Old people have a lot of skills that we younger people lack.  Like the ability to give directions based on local information. Yesterday I got the following directions from an old man.  "Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live and if you pass aphothecary you've gone too far"

So after Brads pushing me out of my comfort zone, I feel I learned a little bit about comedy.  I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs "You can lead a Herring to water, but you have to do it real fast or he'll die." Actually, thats a quote from Gary Busey but I think the point still holds.
