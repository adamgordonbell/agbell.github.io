<p>The comedy book suggests I take some common idioms or quotes and rewrite them to be funny. Here is what I have got:</p>
<p>The customer is always writing me angry emails</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is * going to need to be fixed when I visit my uncles house * going confuse my mom</p>
<p>Speaking of Technology. Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a truly epic battle, try watching my mom attempt to “find the internet” by wandering around her house with her Ipad.</p>
<p>And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly. Yesterday my wife’s great uncle responded to her EMAIL with a hand written letter. She looked about as confused as Rob Ford on jeopardy. It came in the mail! Thats Crazy! I would have been less shocked had it not been addressed. Kourtney O’Dwyer, peterbough, British colony of upper canada. God save the king.</p>
<p>The things is, though, Old people have a lot of skills that I do not. Like the ability to give directions based on local information. Yesterday I got the following directions from an old man. “Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live and if you pass aphothecary you’ve gone too far”</p>
<p>The school I went to as a child was not very diverse. Years later, I’m in university and I met some girls at a bar and one of them happens to have gone to the same school as me, but one year ahead. She said you probably remember me, i was the black kid.</p>
<p>I was at the dentist that other day. Strange thing about me, from a dentists perspective is that I have all my wisdom teeth. Once I asked my dentist about getting them out. And he says, I swear, “Ah, you’ll be fine horse mouth”. And I’m just sitting there, kind of trying to process it while he backtracks says &quot; Ah, you have kind of a big jaw, and …&quot;</p>
<p>So I’d like to thank Brad pushing me out of my comfort zone. I feel I learned a little bit about comedy. I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs “You can lead a Herring to water, but you have to do it real fast or he’ll die.” So actually, thats a quote from Gary Busey but I think the point still holds.</p>
