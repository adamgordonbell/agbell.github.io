<ul>
<li>Reading here in “Comedy Writing Secrets” it says try to focus in on one person, and maybe wink at them to try to get them laughing and hopefully other will follow.</li>
<li>Wink</li>
<li>I find its helpful to say the word wink, as you wink.</li>
<li>In truth, I feel I haven’t totally mastered the wink, one I’ve learned is when not to use them. “No officer, I haven’t been drinking WINK”, “Of course I’ll finish that work on Time Brad, WINK”</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok Winking out of the way, lets go to personal stories</p>
<p>The school I went to as a child was not very diverse. Years later, I’m in university, and learning the world is a much more diverse place. I met some girls at a bar and one of them happens to have gone to the same school as me, but one year ahead. She said you probably remember me, i was the black kid.</p>
<p>I was at the dentist that other day. Strange thing about me, from a dentists perspective is that I have all my wisdom teeth. Once I asked my dentist about getting them out. And he says, I swear, “Ah, you’ll be fine horse mouth”. And I’m just sitting there, kind of trying to process it while he backtracks says &quot; Ah, you have kind of a big jaw, and …&quot;</p>
<p>The comedy book suggests I take some common idioms or quotes and rewrite them to be funny. Here is what I have got:</p>
<p><del>“The ipod completely changed the way we approach music. Ear buds completely change the way I prevent people from talking to me on the bus.”</del></p>
<p>~~ “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly happy is to do what you beleive is great work. And the only way to do what you beleive is great work to be a delusional naricisist.”~~</p>
<p>The customer is always writing me angry emails</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is * going to need to be fixed when I visit my uncles house * going confuse my mom</p>
<p>Speaking of Technology. Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a truly epic battle, watch my mom try to “find the internet” on her tablet.</p>
<p>And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly. Yesterday my wife’s great uncle responded to her email with a hand written letter. She looked about as confused as Rob Ford on jeopardy. It came in the mail! Thats Crazy! I would have been less shocked had it not been addressed. Kourtney O’Dwyer, peterbough, British colony of upper canada. God save the king.</p>
<p>The things is, though, Old people have a lot of skills that I do not. Like the ability to give directions based on local information. Yesterday I got the following directions from an old man. “Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live and if you pass aphothecary you’ve gone too far”</p>
<p>So after Brads pushing me out of my comfort zone, I feel I learned a little bit about comedy. I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs “You can lead a Herring to water, but you have to do it real fast or he’ll die.” Actually, thats a quote from Gary Busey but I think the point still holds.</p>

<li>Reading here in “Comedy Writing Secrets” it says, working with groups of 10 or less is the hardest audience availabe in comedy. Try to focus in on one person, and maybe wink at them to try to get them laughing and hopefully other will follow.</li>
<li>Wink</li>
<li>I find its helpful to say the word wink, as you wink.</li>

<p>Ideas: * So after Brads pushing me out of my comfort zone, I feel I learned a little bit about comedy. I would like to end with a quote from Steve Jobs “You can lead a Herring to water, but you have to do it real fast or he’ll die.” Actually, thats a quote from Rose on the Golden Girls, Bettie White, but I think the point still holds.</p>
<p>Why we laugh : * Surprise and Superiority</p>
<p>Recipe for Humor : Threes * Target - Humor is criticism cloaked as entertainment and directed at a specific target. * Hostility * Realism * Exaggeration * Emotion * Surprise</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>Favorite Comedians 1. Norm McDonald * “With hitler, The more I learn about that guy, the more I don’t care for him” * Target: hitler * Funny: expecting something controversial, don’t get it * Surprise — 1. Louie CK * “I hate when people ask me the time on the street ’cause something happens to me. I just panic. I always end up saying something useless, like, ’It’s 20 of 9:40.” * Target: himself * Funny: picturing him saying something akward * Superiority 1. Dennis Miller * “Forget Stone Cold Steve Austin or the Rock, if you want to see real wrestling, watch our newly elected president pronounce the word”unilateral.&quot; * Target: bush * Funny: setup wrestling then go to bush burn * Superiority 1. Denis Leary * “Why hate someone by the color of there skin when there are so many other reasons to hate him” * Target: ? * Funny: message of not hating, into message of better hate * Surprise 1. Jerry Seinfeld * “It’s amazing the amount of news that happens each day always exactly fills the paper” 1. Dmitry Martin * “When someone describes themselves as a taxpayer, they’re about to be an asshole” * Irate citizens * Funny: ? 1. Chris Rock * “I used to make minimum wage, That is your boss telling you, they wish they could pay you less but that would be against the law” 1. Zach Galifiankis * “Somebody the other day said to me, ‘no offence, but you look like that guy from the hangover’, No Offence?”&quot; 1. Mitch Hedberg * I don’t have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who’d be mad at me for saying that * Target: girlfriend * funny: reversal 1. Ellen Degenerous * “I would like to end with a quote from Mark Twain …. that was actually taylor swift, but she does have a point” 1. Dave Chapelle</p>
<p>Hostility List: * Customers? * telemarketers * politicians? *</p>
<p>Customer: The customer is always right * The customer is always writing me angry emails</p>
<p>One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man. * Good software can do the job of 50 office workers. Especailly the roughly 35% of the work day they spend liking cat vidoes on facebook</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic. * going confuse my mom * going to need to be fixed when I visit my uncles house * will be used by my dad to update his Linked in profile to “Self Employeed and Loving it”</p>
<p>Forget Womens UFC, if you want to see a true battle, watch my mom try to “find the internet” on her tablet.</p>
<p>And my mom has nothing on the truly elderly. Yesterday my wife looked more confused than Rob Ford would look on jeopardy, when he great uncle responded to her email with a hand written letter.

<p>Old people have a lot of skills that we younger people lack however. Like the ability to give directions based on local information. In the era before GPS’s I once got the following directions from an old man. “Now your going to want to drive straight for a good bit and then turn left where Chalky Anderson used to live, then take a right near where that Eye talian apothecary is and if you see the signs for HogTown you’ve gone to far.” Hogtown I learned the hard way, after driving 20 minutes in teh wrong direction, is the nickname for Toronto used in the 1920’s&quot;</p>
<p>Computer: * a really big smartphone that can’t make phone calls</p>
<p>“The ipod completely changed the way we approach music. Ear buds completely change the way I prevent people from talking to me on the bus.”</p>
<p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly happy is to do what you beleive is great work. And the only way to do what you beleive is great work is delusional narcissism.”</p>
<p>“software development is like”</p>
