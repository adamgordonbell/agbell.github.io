If I could combine the features I love from a bunch of keyboards ....
<!--more-->

* Size / Simplicity / Durability of planck
* Split like  Let's Split
* Bluetooth
* two more rows, compared to planck
* One thumb cluster key on each hand, that is sligthly lower
 * This seems to violate the planck form factor, so not sure how to make that work
